# Julia-set-generator
Julia Set generator application in Python using tkinter, matplotlib and numpy
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The entire project comes in one file however I may change that to divide the code into separate files
Clone repository using <bold>git clone https://github.com/Leonidasw/Julia-set-generator.git</bold>
Run the file np.py and you will obtain a menu where you may control the 2 values of the Julia set equation, press go and you will get the result that you may download as an image
